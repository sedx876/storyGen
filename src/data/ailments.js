  "Morgellons-According to the Morgellons Research Foundation, crawling, biting and stinging sensations and the emergence of strange blue, black or red fibers from the skin characterize a disease that nearly 14,000 people suffer from, according to the Foundation. This is often accompanied by exhaustion, short-term memory loss, joint pain and changes in vision. The condition was named Morgellons in 2002 by a mother who believed her two-year-old son was suffering from the disease. The name comes from a 17th century skin condition found in France, in which children died after the emergence of 'dark hair.' However, there is much debate over whether the condition actually exists. In March 2008, the Journal of Dermatologic Therapy reported that most doctors believe it to be form of delusion, in which sufferers falsely believe they are infected with parasites. Consequently, the fibers in the skin are thought to be textile-based, picked up by oozing scabs resulting from more common conditions such as eczema or scabies.",
"Progeria-Progeria is congenital, meaning a defect or damage to a fetus. Sufferers of this fatal illness have a striking appearance resembling premature ageing, but die at an average age of 13. Profound growth delays begin at between nine and 24 months, leading to abnormal facial developments such as a disproportionately small face, bulging, prominent eyes and an underdeveloped jaw. By the age of two, hair from the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes is lost. The U.S. National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD)says sufferers eventually lose the layer of fat beneath the skin and, in time, elasticity is lost in artery walls, leading to fatality via heart attack or stroke in 90 percent of sufferers.",
"Aquagenic Urticaria-Known to have ever affected only 30 people, water allergy or 'aquagenic urticaria' is extremely rare, but its existence has been confirmed by the Medical Review Board. Sufferers appear to be allergic to water. It usually occurs late in life and often as a consequence of a hormonal imbalance brought about by giving birth. A case emerged in the UK in April this year, leaving a 21-year-old mother unable to drink water or get caught in the rain because her skin develops a painful burning rash. She can shower for a maximum of 10 seconds per week and can drink only Diet Coke. It is not strictly an allergy but a hypersensitivity to the ions found in non-distilled water.",
"Foreign accent syndrome-Sufferers of foreign accent syndrome inexplicably find themselves talking in an unrecognizable dialect. Only 60 cases have ever been recorded. Doctors initially dismissed it as a psychiatric problem, but in 2002, scientists at Oxford University, England, observed that sufferers shared the same brain abnormalities, which led to changes in speech pitch, lengthening of vowel sounds and other irregularities. According to the Journal of Neurolinguistics, sufferers don't necessarily have to have been exposed to the accent they adopt: their new voice is not, strictly speaking, a foreign accent, but the changes in speech often bear a striking resemblance to other world accents. The first case concerned a Norwegian woman in 1941, who developed a strong German accent and was ostracized from her community.",
"Laughing Death-Laughing Death, more commonly known as Kuru, was exclusive to the tribal Fore people of New Guinea. The disease, which was characterized by sudden bursts of maniacal laughter, hit the headlines in the 1950s and drew in doctors from around the world. U.S. and Australian physicians observed men and women with shaking limbs, which subsided with rest, but a month to three months later sufferers would begin to sway and stumble, lose the ability to stand, become cross-eyed and lose the power of coherent speech before eventually dying. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reported that tests on the deceased showed death had been caused by the emergence of holes in the brain, known as 'swiss-cheesing.' Eventually the U.S. physician Carleton Gajdusek worked out that the infection was being passed on through the village custom of eating family members after death. When cannibalism was eliminated, the epidemic came to an end. In 1976, Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work.",
"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP)-In 1938, when American Harry Eastlack was five-years-old, he broke his leg. The fracture didn't set properly, his hip and knee stiffened up and, bizarrely, bone growths developed on the muscles of his thigh. By his mid 20s, the vertebrae of his back had begun to fuse together. When he died aged 39 in 1973, he was able to move only his lips. He suffered from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare disease affecting some 1 in 2 million people, in which the body's tendons and ligaments undergo a strange metamorphosis, essentially a transformation into bone. The condition is congenital and characterized by a malformation of the big toe that is present at birth. Eastlack donated his skeleton to research of the disease, and it is on display at the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. The International FOP Association continues to research this extremely rare condition.",
"Alice in Wonderland syndrome-According to the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, sufferers of Alice in Wonderland syndrome perceive objects as being far smaller than they are. The condition, also known as micropsia or Lillliput sight, can also affect the sense of hearing, touch and perceptions of one's own body image. The syndrome is associated with migraine headaches and named after Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in which Alice goes through many bizarre experiences similar to those which might be experienced by a micropsia sufferer. The fact that Carroll suffered from migraines is well documented, and some speculate that his suffering may have prompted many passages in the work.",
"Porphyria-Purple urine and feces make porphyria infamous, as does the fact that the 'mad' 18th century English King George III may have suffered from it. Porphyria leads to complications in the production of 'heme,' a protein vital to red blood cells, and affects the skin and nervous system. Attacks lead to abdominal pain, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and constipation.NORD lists other symptoms including increasing sensitivity to the sun, itching and swelling. Increased hair growth on the forehead may also occur. Toxins resulting from the failed heme production can affect the coloring of other areas, especially after exposure to sunlight. Sometimes the teeth and fingernails can adopt a reddish appearance. It is these toxins that lead to the dark urine and feces. Mary Queen of Scots, Vincent Van Gogh, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon may have suffered from this disease.",
"Pica-The magpie, Latin name pica, will eat anything, and so will sufferers of pica syndrome. Almost always pregnant women or children, sufferers develop an appetite for non-nutritive substances, such as paint, clay, plaster or dirt, or alternatively items that are more commonly considered to be food ingredients, such as raw rice, flour or salt. It can only be considered pica if the appetite persists for over a month and the sufferer is of an age where eating these objects is considered developmentally inappropriate. Medical researchers have tenuously linked pica with a mineral deficiency, but according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, experts have yet to nail down a real, firm cause or cure for this strange disorder.",
"Moebius syndrome-Moebius is extremely rare, genetic and characterized by complete facial paralysis. Sufferers cannot close their eyes, look from side to side, or form facial expressions. Limb abnormalities such as clubbed feet and missing fingers are often also present. According to the Moebius Syndrome Foundation, most cases are isolated, with no notable family history, and sufferers go on to lead long and healthy lives. Family members often learn to recognize body language, posture and vocal tone as communicators of emotion, and sometimes claim they forget the person has facial paralysis altogether.",
"Methemoglobinemia-If you've heard of blue skin disorder—where a person's skin actually turns a Smurf-like shade of blue—that's due to the blood disorder methemoglobinemia. And the reasoning behind the color? The body’s overproduction of methemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin. Instead of the typical one percent of methemoglobin in the blood, those with this disease can have up to 20 percent. And because their hemoglobin is unable to properly distribute oxygen in the body, it results in a blue skin color, purple lips, and brown-colored blood, says Genetics Home Reference. While the disorder can be inherited, it can also come about by being exposed to different chemicals and drugs.",
"Trichotillomania-Everyone occasionally plays with their hair, but when you begin pulling it out, that's what's called trichotillomania. That urge causes hair loss, and while the cause is unknown, it's thought that it could be a subcategory of OCD. Unfortunately, the patches of baldness that result—even in the eyelashes, eyebrows, and beard—can cause even more emotional distress in the individuals affected, according to the National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD).",
"Tree man's disease-Tree man disease—or epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)—is an inherited skin disorder where wart-like lesions develop due to the human papillomavirus. Not just any warts, though: They build up so much on the hands and feet that it results in a 'tree-like' appearance and becomes difficult for those with the disorder to use them, according to the Rare Disease Report. Unfortunately, there's no current treatment besides trying to prevent the warts in the first place and using surgery to remove them.",
"Vampire syndrome-Vampires might be a thing of spooky stories, but xeroderma pigmentosum is a real (yet rare) skin disorder that makes people have heightened sensitivity to the sun's UV rays. So much so that, according to NORD, they have a 10,000-fold increased risk of developing skin cancer. Because of this, those with the condition often avoid the sun to avoid blisters and other damage that can occur in as little as 10 minutes of sun exposure.",
"Werewolf syndrome-Like vampires, werewolves are typically only seen in scary movies. But there's a disorder called werewolf syndrome, or hypertrichosis lanuginosa congenita, that causes excessive werewolf-like hair growth across the entire body—face included—in both men and women. It can be hard to get rid of, resulting in a lot of emotional pain, says the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology. While it can be present at birth, it can also develop later on in life, too.",
"Alien hand syndrome-How scary would it be if your hand started thinking for itself? That's exactly what happens with alien hand syndrome. According to the Baylor University Medical Center, past instances of the rare disorder involve someone's hand acting as if it was being controlled by someone else. One 77-year-old woman's hand was even stroking her face without her permission. In other cases, the hand has tried harming the individual. While it can be tricky to diagnose since it's a neurological disorder, it's usually done through observation and often develops after some sort of trauma or a stroke.",
"Body integrity identity disorder-Sufferers of a bizarre medical condition called 'body integrity identity disorder' (BIID), who are otherwise totally sane, feel as if one of their body parts their right foot up to the mid-calf, for example shouldn't be there. The limb seems horrific and alien, and they can usually draw a line in the exact place where they desperately wish to have it removed. The neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran recently uncovered the cause of the condition: BIID sufferers are missing part of their body image map in their brains. Their unwanted limb is not correctly mapped onto the corresponding brain region, leaving them feeling extremely uncomfortable with it. There is currently no cure but for the uncharted limb to be removed, and when a sympathetic surgeon agrees to amputate, BIID sufferers report feeling infinitely happier.",
"Mass hysteria-As the name implies, this little-understood psychological condition sets in among a group of people typically a gaggle of young girls who spontaneously manifest the same or similar hysterical symptoms, such as seizures, convulsions or fainting. Sufferers believe they all have the same disease or illness, but in fact they're all in good physical health. A famous historical case resulted in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Dozens of people were accused of (and hanged for) causing several young girls in and around Salem, Mass., to have frequent seizures and convulsions. (The image shows Mary Walcott, 17, convulsing on the courthouse floor during one of the trials.) The girls were posthumously diagnosed with mass hysteria.Accusations of witchcraft no longer fly, but mass hysteria is alive and well. Recently, Thera Sanchez, a high school cheerleader in upstate New York, developed strange physical and vocal tics; this led to a dozen other girls and one boy in her school developing the same Tourette's-like symptoms. Officials initially wondered if the students were being poisoned, but psychiatrists recognized the phenomenon as a modern day case of mass hysteria.",
"Parasitic twin-When a twin embryo begins developing in utero, but the pair does not fully separate and one embryo dominates the other, the weaker twin stops developing and turns into a 'parasitic twin' a non-functional, non-conscious collection of extra body parts attached to the healthy remaining twin. Sometimes, the healthy twin is born and raised packing this extra weight. This was the case with Laloo the Hindoo, an Indian man with a parasitic twin attached to his abdomen that had two arms, two legs and a penis but no head; Laloo performed as a sideshow freak in P.T. Barnum's circus at the turn of the 19th century. Today, whenever possible, the parasitic twin is removed. In a recent case in Peru, a three-year-old absorbed his twin into his stomach while the two were gestating in the womb. Doctors successfully removed the boy's parasitic twin Jan. 30.",
"Cotard delusion-Is there anything stranger than an otherwise-sane person wholeheartedly believing he or she is dead? Cotard delusion, otherwise known as walking corpse syndrome, is an extremely rare condition whereby people wake up one day and think they have died, that they no longer exist, or that their flesh is rotting off. It's all in their head, of course, but there's a physical cause nonetheless: The brain region involved in facial recognition has become disconnected from the regions involved in emotion. When the person looks in the mirror, they recognize themselves, but they don't have the usual emotional response. Their appearance has lost its association with their sense of self, and this cognitive dissonance results in the sense that they do not exist, or have died.",
"Facial Blindness (also called Prosopagnosia)-The word 'prosopagnosia' comes from the Greek words 'prósopo' meaning 'face' and 'agnōsia,' which means 'ignorance.' Many of us forget names easily, but people with facial blindness may struggle to identify even familiar faces, or to tell people apart. There are varying degrees of the condition, and those with a severe form may be unable to distinguish between a face and another object, or to recognize their own face.",
"Jerusalem Syndrome-Unless you’ve read comedian Marc Maron’s memoir “The Jerusalem Syndrome: My Life as Reluctant Messiah,” you probably don’t know much about this psychological disorder. It occurs when a visit to the Holy Land triggers obsessive ideas about religion and even messianic delusions. The condition can affect anyone, regardless of religion. Symptoms may include compulsive cleaning and grooming, wearing white robes, and sermonizing. 'Sufferers without a pre-existing psychiatric condition typically return to normal within five to seven days, feel some shame about their behavior, and recover completely,' says Christine Montross, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University.
